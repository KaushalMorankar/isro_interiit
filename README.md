# High-Resolution Lunar Elemental Mapping using X-Ray Fluorescence (XRF)

## Introduction

This repository contains resources, codes, and reports related to the development of a high-resolution elemental ratio map of the Moon using X-ray fluorescence (XRF) data obtained from the Chandrayaan-2 Large Area Soft X-ray Spectrometer (CLASS). The project aims to identify compositional heterogeneity at the kilometer scale by processing and analyzing XRF spectra.

## Methodology

The following methodology is adopted to generate high-resolution elemental ratio maps:

## Deadlines

The following deliverables will be part of this project:

1. **Mid-Term Report**:
   - Catalog of XRF line detections and elements identified (10% weightage)
   - Map coverage of XRF lines onto a lunar base map (10% weightage)
   - Compositional groups based on derived ratios (10% weightage)
2. **End-Term Report**:
   - Dynamic and interactive mapping of elemental ratios onto a lunar base map (40% weightage)
   - Identification of best elemental ratios for compositional analysis (20% weightage)
   - Sub-pixel resolution maps to enhance compositional details (10% weightage)
