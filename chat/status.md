# MID TERM

Hello all,

Following are the guidelines for Mid Term Report of ISRO Problem Statement
Mid Term Report (NO PAGE LIMIT) should contain the methodology, coverage map for each line detected and any cluster or groups

yerived from the ratios
1. A catalogue of XRF line detections and the elements along with source codes
2. Map the coverage of the XRF lines onto a lunar base map
3. Compositional groups based on ratios
Note: These three tasks are to be submitted as a part of the mid-term report. If a task from these three is completed after the mid-term
report, then it will receive only half weightage
Few pointers to look at:
1. Catalogue as a CSV file
2. Compositional group: Lunar surface has different rocks and minerals whose elemental ratios are different, for example high Al, low
Mg are anorthosite rocks
Refer this to know classification based on elemental ratios: https://sites.wustl.edu/meteoritesite/items/the-chemical-composition-of-
lunar-soil/

3. Note: The Class instrument is not an imaging tool, so ground pixel resolution is defined by the field of view and the spacecraft's
altitude. The FITS files contain the latitude and longitude of the four corners of the ground pixel in their header. If you get the ratios
from a single file (with an 8s exposure) it will be a 12 km map (12.5 x 12.5 km ground pixels). If you add two files (to improve
statistics), it will be 32 s integration and 25 km (along track) x 12.5 (across track)
Deadline: 14th November 2024, 11:59 PM (submission guidelines will be shared)
Note: Data upto July 2024 has been pushed on the Pradan Website.
